## Objective
The object of the game is to stay alive as long as possible to gain the most amount of points. At first the only obsticle are the boarders of the race track. After you reach 50 points your opponent becomes angry and launches nukes onto the tracks. His anger clouds his vision so fortunitly for us the nukes are launched in random places. After about 32 nukes are launched some of them start to stablize which allow you to drive on top of them without worry of explosive death.
